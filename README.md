# activity2.1.10
Originally started as activity 2.1.10 using movies and ott datasets.  On 22nd April, the same data was used to study (activity 2.2.8) manipulating missing data and changing datasets.  In this latest merge we added in finding new null data in movies, changing null data to means, checking there was no null data left, then changing datatypes to integers so that they could be used for aggregation formulas.  It was not posisble to change datatypes until null values were managed in some way.

Additional work carried out with deleting a column, accessing descriptive statistics, selecting numeric valriables and calculating interquartile ranges.
